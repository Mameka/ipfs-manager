# ipfs-manager
A IPFS helper to upload/download files/folder to IPFS in Python3. The uploaded file is saved in a file with timestamp, hash and name. The file name is "hashes.csv"
If you use the manager, all uploaded data is listed in the "hashes.csv" for for managing it with your office software.
The purpose is to have an overview of your uploaded files in IPFS. Next to the hash  you can see the filename or foldername.
For downloading a file or folder you can search for the name and put in the hash.
The program reads the hashes.csv and shows the whole data of uploaded files.

The IPFS-Manager works well and some more features are in development.
